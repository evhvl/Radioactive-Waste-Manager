# ☢️ Radioactive Waste Manager

## Overview
**Radioactive Waste Manager** is a software application developed as part of my **Master’s thesis in Medical Physics**, focusing on the practical management of radioactive waste and dose-related calculations in a hospital environment.

The project was created to address real-world needs in nuclear medicine workflows, combining **software development** with **medical physics domain knowledge**.

## What the Application Does

- Manages and organizes radioactive waste based on predefined characteristics  
- Supports **dose calculations based on patient-specific parameters**  
- Calculates the **required radioactive volume for a desired dose**, as well as inverse calculations  
- Applies validation rules to reduce input and calculation errors  
- Maintains a clear and structured data flow for traceability and consistency  

The goal of the application is to **support clinical workflows** by reducing manual calculations and improving clarity in radioactive material handling.

## Context & Current Status

This project was developed for my **postgraduate thesis** and is currently in the **final pre-submission stage**.

- The software has been designed with hospital use in mind  
- Real-world testing in a hospital setting is planned and will be conducted under academic supervision  
- Final evaluation and validation will be performed as part of the thesis review process

## Intended Use

The application is intended to be used by **trained healthcare professionals** as a **support tool**.

It does not replace clinical judgment, but assists with:
- structured calculations  
- consistency across workflows  
- reduction of manual errors

## Why This Project

This project reflects my interest in:
- applied software development  
- problem-solving in real clinical environments  
- bridging programming with medical and scientific domains  

It is also part of my transition toward a **software-oriented career**, with a strong focus on real-world, responsibility-driven applications.
